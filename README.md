# Humanize AI Lib

## Why Clean Up GPT Text?

AI-generated content often contains subtle markers that make it obvious to readers (and algorithms) that the text wasn't written by a human:

Em-dashes (‚Äî) instead of regular dash (-)
Fancy quotes (‚Äú ‚Äù) instead of standard ones (")
Unnecessary whitespace or hidden Unicode characters
And other symbols
Cleaning these up makes the text flow more naturally, improving readability and keeping readers engaged.

This package contains humanization function used on http://humanize-ai.click/

## Usage

Usage is simple:

```ts
import { humanizeString } from 'humanize-ai-lib';

const result = humanizeString(inputText, options);

console.log(result.text); // Humanized text
console.log(result.count); // Count of changed symbols
```

Options:
